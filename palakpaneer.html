        <b><p>Palak Paneer is such a staple in north India. Itâ€™s one of the most commonly made paneer dishes in Indian homes.</p>
           <p> I would say it was made much more frequently in my home than say <span style="color:red;">paneer butter masala </span>or shahi paneer.</p>            
          <p>  Maybe because it was considered healthier than the other creamy versions of paneer.</p>
          <p> Whatever the reason was, we would always be very happy when mom made it!</p>
