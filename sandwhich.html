        <b><p>It’s hard to imagine a life without sandwiches, but their popularity wasn’t always so present.</p>
           <p>  According to history, the sandwich we know and love today was created in 1762 in England. </p>
           <p> Most food historians agree that the sandwich is the product of John Montagu, <span style="color:red;">“the 4th Earl of sandwich.” </span></p>
           <p> Montagu was known for being a problematic gambler, spending hours upon hours at the card table.</p>
